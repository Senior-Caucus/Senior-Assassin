    <h3>Rules and Instructions v3</h3>
    <p>
      Please read the following rules and instructions for this specific game mode carefully.
    </p>
    <p>TLDR: Get as many spoon taps as possible before Friday night; one spoon tap = one heart; you lose at most one heart if you are tapped; the people with the most hearts get into the final round.</p>
    <p>No running is allowed (in school). No safety items this week. You don't need to wait for your video to be approved anymore. Good luck.</p>

        <b>Where/How can someone be assassinated?</b>

          <li>Assassinations <b>cannot</b> occur on subway platforms.</li>
          <li>To assassinate, gently tap a spoon on the target's shoulder (plastic spoons from the cafeteria are allowed; no other utensils).</li>
          <li>If you are in school, you are <b>not</b> allowed to run. You may submit evidence of your target running as evidence.</li>
